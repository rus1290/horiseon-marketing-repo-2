This README describes content of Horiseon Marketing website. Horiseon's mission is to provide quality web content to it's customers in a form of websites and webapplications, alongside with serives to improve their online presence through SEO, SMM, and contextual advertising practices.

## My goal as web developer
I was hired by Horiseon Marketing was to refactor code of their website for two main reasons:
Number one was: to make it more accessible by visual minorities.
Number two: tailor it to search engines algorithms to increase company's rankings in Google.

## Work I had completed
To meet my customer's needs, I had edited the HTML code, taking into consideration semantic elements. All sections(nav bar, header, footer, aside and etc) in the website have corresponding tags. All images have a description in alt tags, describing in details what is depicted on an image. I have also changed the <h 1-6> elements, so they follow a logical order, from greatest, to least.
