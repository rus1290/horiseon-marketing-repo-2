# Horiseon Marketing

## This README describes content of Horiseon Marketing website. Horiseon's mission is to provide quality web content to it's customers in a form of websites and webapplications, alongside with serives to improve their online presence through SEO, SMM, and contextual advertising practices.

## My goal as web developer, hired by Horiseon Marketing was to refactor the code of their website, to make it accessible by visual minorities and also tailor it to search engines algorithms to increase company's rankings in Google.

## To meet my customer's needs, I had edited the HTML code, taking into consideration semantic elements. All sections(nav bar, header, footer, aside and etc) in the website have corresponding tags. All images have a description in alt tags, describing in details what is depicted on an image. I have also changed the <h 1-6> elements, so they follow a logical order, from greatest, to least.
